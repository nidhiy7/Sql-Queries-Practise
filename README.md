## WHERE

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator value;
Example:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID=1;
```

`WHERE` is a clause that indicates you want to filter the result set to include only rows where the following *condition* is true.
Operator Used 
```sql
=	Equal	
>	Greater than	
<	Less than	
>=	Greater than or equal	
<=	Less than or equal	
<>	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=	
BETWEEN : Between a certain range	
LIKE:	Search for a pattern	
IN	: To specify multiple possible values for a column
```
